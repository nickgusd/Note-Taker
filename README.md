# Note-Taker

My application has the ability to save, delete, and view old notes in a note taker.

# Description

* The application was created using a local server and the deployed version was created with Heroku.

* When you save a note, the saved notes appear on the lefthand side in the order in which they are created.

* The saved notes can be deleted by clicking on the trashcan icon next to each note.

* If you click on a saved note, the saved note is rendered on the screen where the note was first created.
